    "The main objective for this project is to study the impact on applying Ensemble method in predicting the price movement in stock market. Over this two decades, many researchers have shifted their attention into using Machine Learning algorithms to predict the stock market. This became more common as the advancement of Deep Learning technique such RNN has proven a lot of success in predicting the stock market. However, Ensemble method has also gained its reputation in these recent years due its success in improving the model's accuracy in various sectors such as health, agriculture, energy and finance. Besides that, it has always been adopted by Machine Learning research team at Kaggle competitions where they often achieve impressive results. For example, the top two teams in Netflix competition also utilise Ensemble method to improve their model. Hence, in this project, we will be looking at how Ensemble methods will improve the accuracy in predicting stock market."

    "### Cross Validation\n",
    "Cross validation is normally used to evaluate the model performance and it is a common approach for hyperparameter optimization as the classical approach of cross validation is K-fold cross validation which seperate the data into K-fold and allow every data to be test dataset. This approach ensure that there is no overfitting occur. However, when dealing with stock market which is a time-series dataset, a different approach has to be taken to avoid data leakage. It means the order of the train and test set is important as u should not take data in the future to train and use it to predict the past. Hence, I will be using growing window cross validation in this project."
